This program can make search text in files on your hardware with specific extension.<br>
The default extension is log (you will see it on textbox when programm will be run)<br>
You can find big files (on my pc this program find search text in txt file which size is about 600mb.<br>
 It works around 15 seconds.<br> Because it doesnt read all file - it reads parts of files.<br>
 But you can work only with one file. You can't open simultaniously two files in two tabs; <br>
 You can click on file when program will find text and build tree and you will see text of the file.<br>
 You can scroll and see different pages.<br>
 You cant receive memory error, because it keeps only 1024*3 bytes of text, and on the next page it will remove previously
 <br> page and add new.
